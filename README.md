# Caesar-cipher-cracker

A brute-force encryption cracker for texts that are encrypted with the Caesar's Cipher. Regardless of the key with which the text was encrypted, this program outputs all possible combinations with all the 25 possible keys. However since key 0 is essentially the encrypted test itself, it starts from 1 and goes up to and including 25. Each line has a number indicating the key with which it was decrypted. User has to study output string to discern a sensible decrytpion.

## Example

The text, "Nothing is True.", when encrypted with the key value of 3 becomes: "Qrwklqj lv Wuxh!". If we input the encrypted text into this cracker program, we'll have as output the following lines:
